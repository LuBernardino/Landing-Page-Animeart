<p align="center">Technology event organized by Le Wagon School, in partnership with the Lisbon City Council through the Future of Work Lisboa program.
                  During the event, the challenge was to create a landing page on the subject we wanted (personal, real or fictitious products, etc.), 
                  so here's the page I made for the challenge.
